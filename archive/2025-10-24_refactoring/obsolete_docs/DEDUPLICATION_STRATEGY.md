# FTIR Dataset Deduplication Strategy

**Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Issue**: Duplicate measurements in allspekTable.mat  
**Decision**: Keep earliest session (lowest session number) to match old dataset

---

## Problem Identification

During dataset preparation, it was discovered that some samples have multiple FTIR measurements from different measurement sessions, resulting in duplicate position data:

### Affected Samples

| Sample ID | Proben_ID | Sessions Found | Expected Positions | Actual Positions | Total Spectra |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|
| MEN-080-01 | DD004-T001 | S11, S25 | 3 | 6 | 1536 (768×2) |
| MEN-083-01 | DD007-T001 | S4, S18 | 3 | 6 | 1536 (768×2) |

### Impact
- These duplicates caused incorrect aggregation at the probe level
- Row 76 (MEN-080-01) and Row 85 (MEN-083-01) had 6 positions and 1536 spectra instead of the expected 3 positions and 768 spectra
- This would lead to biased mean spectra and inconsistent sample representation

---

## Analysis Performed

### 1. Visual Inspection
Comparison plots were generated showing:
- Raw spectra from all positions
- Mean spectra overlays for direct comparison

**Files**: 
- `results/duplicate_comparison_raw.png`
- `results/duplicate_comparison_overlay.png`

### 2. Amide Peak Analysis

| Sample | Session | Amide I Peak | Amide II Peak |
|--------|---------|--------------|---------------|
| MEN-080-01 | S25 | 1.0600 | 0.9537 |
| MEN-080-01 | **S11** | **1.4323** | **1.1956** |
| MEN-083-01 | S18 | 0.8616 | 0.7727 |
| MEN-083-01 | **S4** | **0.5368** | **0.4534** |

### 3. Quality Metrics

| Sample | Session | SNR | Baseline Std | Mean Absorbance |
|--------|---------|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| MEN-080-01 | S25 | 80.20 | 0.0111 | 0.4183 |
| MEN-080-01 | **S11** | **48.71** | **0.0213** | **0.5773** |
| MEN-083-01 | S18 | 52.58 | 0.0139 | 0.3639 |
| MEN-083-01 | **S4** | **64.08** | **0.0064** | **0.2270** |

### 4. Correlation with Old Dataset (DECISIVE)

**This was the determining factor for the decision.**

| Sample | Session | Correlation with Old Dataset |
|--------|---------|------------------------------|
| MEN-080-01 | S25 | r = 0.7618 |
| MEN-080-01 | **S11** | **r = 0.9980** ✓ |
| MEN-083-01 | S18 | r = 0.9448 |
| MEN-083-01 | **S4** | **r = 0.9921** ✓ |

The extremely high correlations (r > 0.99) between S11/S4 and the old dataset clearly indicate that **these were the sessions used in the original validated analysis**.

---

## Decision: Match Old Dataset

### Rationale
1. **Primary Goal**: This pipeline is designed to **replicate and validate** previous results
2. **Consistency**: Using the same measurements ensures any differences aren't due to measurement session selection
3. **Validation**: The old dataset has been peer-reviewed and published - it represents the validated measurements
4. **Correlation Evidence**: r > 0.99 correlation definitively identifies which sessions were used previously

### Trade-offs Considered
While S25 showed better SNR metrics than S11:
- **S25 advantages**: Better SNR (80.2 vs 48.7), lower baseline noise
- **S11 advantages**: Stronger Amide peaks, matches validated dataset
- **Decision**: Reproducibility and consistency with validated results takes precedence over marginal quality improvements

## Implementation

### Deduplication Algorithm
Located in: `src/meningioma_ftir_pipeline/prepare_ftir_dataset.m` (Step 0.5)

```matlab
% For each Proben_ID + Position combination:
% 1. Identify all measurements (different sessions)
% 2. Extract session numbers from SourceFile (e.g., "S11" from "DD004-T001-S11_Pos1.0.mat")
% 3. Keep the measurement with the LOWEST session number
% 4. Remove all other measurements for that combination
```

### Rule
**Keep the earliest session (lowest session number) for each Proben_ID + Position combination**

This heuristic:
- ✅ Matches the old dataset (S4 < S18, S11 < S25)
- ✅ Is reproducible and objective
- ✅ Assumes earlier measurements were validated before later ones were acquired
- ✅ Can be applied automatically to any future duplicate discoveries

---

## Validation

### Before Deduplication
- `allspekTable.mat`: 351 positions
- MEN-080-01: 6 positions (DD004-T001-S11: 3, DD004-T001-S25: 3)
- MEN-083-01: 6 positions (DD007-T001-S4: 3, DD007-T001-S18: 3)

### After Deduplication
- `allspekTable.mat`: 345 positions (6 duplicates removed)
- MEN-080-01: 3 positions (DD004-T001-S11: 3) ✓
- MEN-083-01: 3 positions (DD007-T001-S4: 3) ✓
- Both samples: 768 spectra each ✓

### Correlation Verification
After implementing deduplication, mean spectra from the new dataset should have:
- MEN-080-01: r ≈ 0.998 with old dataset ✓
- MEN-083-01: r ≈ 0.992 with old dataset ✓

## Future Considerations

### Monitoring
If new duplicate measurements are discovered:
1. The deduplication algorithm will automatically apply the "lowest session number" rule
2. Check correlation with old dataset to verify correctness
3. Document new cases in this file

### Alternative Approaches NOT Used
1. **Average all sessions**: Would create artificial spectra not matching old dataset
2. **Keep latest session**: No evidence latest is best; contradicts old dataset
3. **Manual selection per case**: Not scalable; introduces subjective bias
4. **Keep highest quality**: Quality metrics alone don't ensure consistency with validated data

## Summary

**What**: Duplicate FTIR measurements from different sessions  
**Why**: To match old validated dataset and ensure reproducibility  
**How**: Keep earliest session (lowest session number) for each position  
**Result**: Perfect consistency with old dataset (r > 0.99 correlation)  
**Impact**: MEN-080-01 and MEN-083-01 now correctly have 3 positions and 768 spectra each

This deduplication is **critical for reproducibility** and ensures the new preprocessing pipeline produces results directly comparable to the validated original analysis.
